# React TODO App

This is a basic Todo App in React to practice my skills in React Hooks. The app will allow the user to create and remove tasks. The user will be able to visualize all the tasks in the screen. Using useState, useReducer and useEffect. You also will be able to sort the tasks based on their completetion (All, completed, uncompleted).
